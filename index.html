                 Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he is not causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping.  </p>
             <p>
                 Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.

            <h2>Finn</h2>

            <img

              alt="Finn wears a bat costume for halloween."

            <p>
              Finn is a 7 year old grey cat. I feel like no one really knows cat breeds so I'm just
              gonna go with grey. He loves doing tricks for treats and his favorite is giving high fives
              to people. He might as well be a dog as he loves the outdoors and meeting new people. I
              can only describe him as goofy and chaotic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finn's biggest enemy is his vet. I don't know whether or not it's because his vet is an MSU alum, but he doesn't like him. He actually has to be prescribed a
              sedative before he goes to the vet office because he'll suddenly act like he was never a house cat for 7 years.

            <h2>Milktea</h2>

            <img src="images/pets/Main.jpg" alt="Milktea taking nap" width="400" />
    
            <p>
              Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and
              refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of
              any sort by complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be
              translated, it probably would be, & This is atrocious, the water container has been
              empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder
              intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold
              because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. Cartilage
              accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even
              walk. She is living evidence of human's cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty
              while sacrificing the animals' health.

            <h2>Jingle</h2>

            <img src="images/pets/Jingle.jpg" alt="" width="400">
         

            <p>Jingle is a domestic shorthair cat with a white chest and belly and a striped black and gray back. His paws are white and they look like mittens.  </p>
            
            <p> Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get injured. Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes crazy and meows to go out. </p>
            
            <p>Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside; a bee stung his paw and he cried all night long. The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for four days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out. 
            </p>

            <p>Lucy is a 17-year-old calico that I have had since I was 5, she has pretty much grown up with me my whole life. Even though she is old, she is still kickin it and enjoys running around the house at 4am. </P>
             <p> Her favorite foods include anything but her kibble. She enjoys sunbathing and long naps, along with lots of petting. However, she hates getting her stomach rubbed.
